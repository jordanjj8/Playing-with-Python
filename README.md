# exercising_with_python

Just a bunch of scripts I used to learn how to code in python more effectively. These exercises come from the python crash course.
I gotta say, I love the simplicity of this book. I think learning how to code is really an iterative process, and I don't think anyone
else has done a better job than Eric Matthes in this.
